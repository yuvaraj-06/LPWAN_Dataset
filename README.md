#### Detials
    Real_Test_Bed_Data.csv contains total of 300 IoT devices with one gateway are deployed 
    over a 2 km Ã— 2 km dimensional area.The position of gateway is (1000, 1000).
    
#### Addiontal Information
      Each IoT device consists 72000 (5V, 4000 mAh battery) Joules of energy. The
      data transmission utilizes LoRa model with transmit power 14 dBm having a 
      spreading factor of 7. The bandwidth is 125 kHz with a 4/5 coding rate. 
      The power received by an IoT device located at a distance of 160 m from 
      the source device is -82 dBm, while this value is -123 dBm if the separation
      distance between devices is 520 m.
